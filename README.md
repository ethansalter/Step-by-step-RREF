This program was developed to enable the quick computation of the reduced row echelon form of a user defined input matrix. To operate, run the main.py file. This will open up a main menu, where the user can input one of several different options.

To edit the matrix, press '3' and enter. This will open up the matrix editor in the Notepad app (Windows). If user does not have the Notepad app installed, the file "input.csv" must be accessed by opening the file manually. Please add values row by row, delineating with commas after each new input.

To view the current matrix, input '2' on the main menu. This will display the current stored matrix.

To perform the rref operation on the stored matrix, input '3' on the main menu. This will perform all the necessary row operations to construct a reduced row echelon form of a user defined input matrix. This matrix will be stored in the file 'output.csv' and can be accessed by the user.
